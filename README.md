## BERT
BERT stands for **Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformer**. BERT can be thought of as a sentence embedding model which can perform various tasks such as sentiment analysis, Text Classification and Question Answering. It's a speical type of transformer which is much simpler but equally powerful for a wide spectrum of task.(**Caution : Don't think of it as a replacement to transformer).

## Notebook
This is just a basic notebook for introduction of BERT and how we tokenize the sentences using Huggingface BERT Tokenizer.

### Key-Learning : bert_tokenizer don't apply sub-tokenization for tokenizing the sentences.
